# 1. Start with a Good Shower Routine

Your journey to smelling amazing begins in the shower. Make it count!

- **Use a Scented Body Wash:** Opt for trending options like Sol de Janeiro’s Brazilian 4 Play Moisturizing Shower Cream-Gel or OGX Coconut Coffee Scrub and Wash for a creamy, invigorating cleanse.
- **Exfoliate Regularly:** Dead skin can trap odors. Gently scrub with Tree Hut’s Moroccan Rose Shea Sugar Scrub to keep your skin fresh and soft.
- **Don’t Skip Your Hair:** Use a shampoo and conditioner that smells divine, like the Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo paired with No.5 Conditioner.

# 2. Hydrate Your Skin

Dry skin doesn’t hold onto scents as well as hydrated skin. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!

Customers love how lightweight yet deeply nourishing they are, with many calling them “the best body oil ever tried.” 🌿 Plus, each order comes with a free gift, making it an irresistible upgrade to your daily self-care.
- **Layer Scents for Longevity:** Match your body wash and lotion scents if possible, or choose complementary fragrances.

# 4. Keep Your Clothes Fresh

Fresh-smelling clothes make a big difference. Here’s how to ensure your wardrobe contributes to your all-day freshness:

- **Use Scent Boosters in Your Laundry:** Add a capful of Downy Unstopables or Gain Fireworks Scent Beads to your laundry for long-lasting freshness.
- **Store Clothes with Scented Sachets:** Place lavender or cedar sachets in your drawers and closet to keep clothes smelling clean.
- **Air Out Your Clothes:** If you’ve been in a stuffy environment, hang your outfit outside for a few minutes to freshen it up.
