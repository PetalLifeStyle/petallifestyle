## Is Music Haram in Islam? Qur’an and Hadith Evidence Explained

Assalamualaikum 🌸

Do you ever stop listening to music… only to find the lyrics replaying in your head during salah?

Do you feel guilt after listening, yet struggle to leave it completely?

You’re not alone.

Many Muslims know music affects the heart - but don’t understand *why* Islam warns against it, or *how* to actually stop without feeling empty or bored.

In this guide, we’ll explore:

• What the Qur’an and Hadith say about music  
• How music impacts the heart and khushu‘  
• Practical, Islamic steps to leave music without replacing it with another addiction

# What does the Qur’an say about music?

Allah says in the Qur’an:

>"But there are some who employ theatrics,<sup>1</sup> only to lead others away from Allah’s Way—without any 
knowledge—and to make a mockery of it. They will suffer a humiliating punishment." [Surah: Luqman, 6]

📌 Footnote 1: Some pagan Arabs used to use singing, chanting, and entertainment to 
distract people from listening to the Qur’an.

Check reference: [Qur’an 31:6 on Quran.com](https://quran.com/31?startingVerse=6)

> If this ayah made you uncomfortable, pause. That discomfort is the heart waking up - not guilt meant to crush you.

# Spiritual Effects of Music in Islam

### 1. It corrupts the heart
Music slowly hardens the heart.

At first, it feels harmless. But over time, the sweetness of Qur’an fades, remembrance becomes heavy, and sins begin to feel lighter.

When the heart fills with music, it has less room for the words of Allah.

### 2. It replaces dhikr
Instead of saying SubhanAllah (Allah is free from imperfection) or reciting a Surah while doing chores, we tend to hum lyrics.

### 3. It interferes with Salah
You stand before Allah in salah.

Your body is facing the qiblah but your mind is replaying lyrics you listened to earlier.

This is one of the greatest harms of music: it follows you into worship, stealing khushu‘ from moments meant only for Allah.

### 4. It promotes vulgarity
Most songs promote zina, pride, arrogance, immodesty, even shirk and the list goes on. For example, a Bengali song says: “A girl wearing anklets on feet tinted with alta (red dye), Oh that girl in borqa has driven me crazy.”
Can you imagine how disrespectful that is to Muslim women? I can't believe how nobody raises their voice against these cheap lyrics!

### 5. What did the Prophet ﷺ say about music?

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> “This ummah will experience the swallowing up of some people by the earth, transformation of some into animals, and being pelted with stones.”
>A man asked: “When will this be?”
>He ﷺ replied: “When female singers and musical instruments appear, and alcohol will be consumed.”
(Sunan Tirmidhi, v.2 p.44)

Check reference [here](https://islamqa.org/hanafi/daruliftaa-birmingham/20054/punishment-of-listening-to-music/).

In another narration,the Prophet ﷺ said: 
>“From among my followers there will be people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, drinking of alcohol, and the use of musical instruments as lawful…Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.” (Sahih al-Bukhari).

Check reference [here](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5590).

Now that we have a grasp of how harmful music can be, let's explore what we can do to protect ourselves from this dangerous thing.

# How to Stop Listening to Music – Step by Step

### 1. Cancel subscriptions & delete music apps:
Cancel any subscriptions you have on music apps. If you're subscribed to any music-related newsletters, unsubscribe from those as well. Don’t just delete the app - first, delete your account (like on Spotify or any other music platform), and then uninstall the app from your device.
If you feel any hesitation while doing this, keep reminding yourself: 
>“I am doing this for Allah. Nothing is more important to me than His pleasure.”

Keep saying **“Astaghfirullah”** and move forward with determination.


### 2. Reflect on how much money you waste on music:
Take a moment to open your bank statement and see how much money you've poured into something that is displeasing to your Creator. Now imagine the good that same money could have done. 
>You could have bought a gift for your mother, or gifted someone a Qur'an or a hijab - acts that count as Sadaqah Jariyah, meaning you continue to earn rewards every time they use those items for good.

>You could have given that money as sadaqah, bringing more barakah into your wealth. Or invested it in the small business you've always dreamed of starting but kept delaying out of fear of losing money - while ironically, you were already letting your money go down the drain by subscribing to things that are haram.

>That same money could have gone to our brothers and sisters in Palestine who are suffering from hunger and hardship, while you were listening to music without a care in the world.


### 3. Put away your headphones:
Place your headphones somewhere out of reach, perhaps with your parents or in a spot that’s not easily accessible. Let’s be honest: in most cases, we use them to listen to music rather than lectures or anything beneficial. So, if possible, switch to speaker mode when listening to something important. That way, you’ll be less tempted to drift back into music.

### 4. Block music sites:
Use blocking extensions or apps to keep yourself from visiting music sites. Here are some apps and chrome extension you can use:
> Mobile App: Appblock, Freedom, BlockSite.

>Web extension: [StayFocusd](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stayfocusd-%E2%80%93-website-bloc/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en), [FocusGuard](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/focusguard-block-site-foc/ifdepgnnjpnbkcgempionjablajancjc?hl=en), [StayFree](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stayfree-website-blocker/elfaihghhjjoknimpccccmkioofjjfkf?hl=en), [Block Site](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/block-site/lebiggkccaodkkmjeimmbogdedcpnmfb?hl=en).

### 5. Remember Allah is watching:
As believers, we hold the conviction that Allah sees us at all times. Now imagine this: you're curled up in bed, earphones plugged in, immersed in music—right in front of the One who is sustaining your every breath. The One who gave you a home, blessed you with loving parents, and freed you from the worries of food, money, and health.
Take a moment to reflect: is this how you want to present yourself before Him? Would you ever do something disliked by someone who has showered you with favors? Of course not. So why do we forget this when it comes to our Creator?
>Let this awareness be a wake-up call. Let it stir your heart. Because the One who gave you everything deserves better than being ignored while you indulge in what He dislikes.


### 6. Remember death can come anytime:
As believers, we know that death can come at any moment. It doesn’t wait for old age, illness, or accidents. It can arrive suddenly - even while you're reading this.
So the next time you reach for your earphones to listen to music, pause and ask yourself: *Is this how I want to take my last breath?*
Do I want to leave this world with haram in my ears, my eyes fixed on something displeasing to Allah? Or do I want my final moment to be in salah, in sujood, in a state of remembrance and purity?
What kind of afterlife do you imagine for someone who dies with music playing in their ears, versus someone who dies while bowing before their Creator?

### 7. Honor the blessings before they’re taken away:
Allah has showered us with ni'mah, blessings beyond measure. He gave us food to nourish us, clothes to protect us, hands to work, feet to walk, eyes to see, ears to hear. Yet how often do we use these very gifts in disobedience to Him?
There are people who live without these blessings, and still they remain grateful. Meanwhile, we who have them, often forget their value. We use our eyes to watch what displeases Allah, our ears to listen to what He warned us against.
Pause and reflect: while you're listening to music, Allah has the power to take away your hearing. While you're watching something haram, He can take away your sight. And if that moment becomes your last, 
>What will be the final thing you see? Not the Qur'an. Not the Ka'bah.
What will be the last thing you hear? Not the Adhaan. Not the words of Allah.

It will be what He told you to stay away from.
And then what? No matter how much you cry, you won’t be able to turn back time. You’ll carry the weight of regret throughout your life!
So use your blessings wisely. Let your eyes witness beauty that pleases Allah. Let your ears echo the words of the Qur'an. Let your limbs move in worship, not in rebellion.


### 8. Turn temptation into dua
Whenever you feel tempted to listen to music or engage in something haram, pause. Resist. That moment of struggle is not wasted—it can become a source of immense reward.
Did you know you can turn that resistance into a dua? Say:
>“Ya Allah, I was tempted to do something You’ve forbidden, but I held back—not for anyone else, only for You. If this act of restraint pleases You even a little, then grant me [insert your wish].”

This is a powerful and proven method.Try it. Every time you resist, you’re planting seeds of reward in the Hereafter.

### 9. Make dua for dislike of haram
Turn to Allah and make dua from the depths of your heart:
>“Ya Allah, make me dislike what You dislike. Remove the love of sin from my heart and replace it with love for Your obedience.”

### 10. Make the task easy with dua
Make dua to Allah to ease it for you. There’s a beautiful dua that always stays on the tip of my tongue, and I encourage you to make it part of your daily prayers:

### 11. Replace music with nasheeds (vocal-only)
If you're struggling with the habit of listening to music, try replacing it with nasheed. It’s a gentle shift that can actually boost your imaan. I personally find strength in a Bengali nasheed about parda—whenever I feel tempted to loosen my hijab, it brings me back to my purpose.
But be cautious: not all nasheeds are free from musical instruments. Some include background music, and even vocal imitations of instruments can be controversial. Scholars differ on this, but Allah knows best. So let’s aim for *‘azimah’*—not just what’s *ja’iz* (permissible), but what’s best. We’re not here to scrape by—we want to pass with flying colors, just like in our exams.
If you’re looking for pure vocals, skip YouTube and explore dedicated nasheed websites. You can even create your own playlist of vocals-only nasheeds and share it with others—it might help someone else on their journey too.

### 12. Listen to Qur’an instead
Instead of turning to music when you're walking, relaxing, or sitting idly, choose the Qur’an. Listening to the Qur’an in peaceful moments can be deeply transformative—it calms the soul, corrects your tajwid, and strengthens your connection with Allah.
But be mindful: scholars advise against listening to the Qur’an while multitasking or working on other things. Why? Because Allah commands us to be attentive when His words are recited:
>“When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.”
— [Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204]

**For replacing music with focused Qur’an time:** 
<div style="flex: 1 1 200px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://eternah.com/cdn/shop/files/IMG_20250707_172128_395.png?v=1752009509&width=1000" alt="The Juz 30 Quran Journal" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

  </div>

To truly benefit, give the Qur’an your full attention. And here’s a beautiful truth:
>When halal enters the heart, it pushes the haram out.

### 13. Be mindful of hidden sources of music:
Music isn’t just in playlists—it’s embedded in Instagram reels, Messenger stories, and other social media content. These are often overlooked, but they count too. If you're serious about avoiding music, be intentional with how you consume content.
>Try watching reels with your headphones unplugged and your volume set to zero. 

It might seem small, but this simple act makes the content less engaging—and over time, you’ll find yourself spending less time on it altogether.

### 14. Keep Deeni company
The people you surround yourself with shape your path. Spend time with those who remind you of your deen, who encourage you to stay firm in your values, and who gently pull you back when you drift. A deeni companion makes the journey easier—not because they’re perfect, but because they’re striving too. On the other hand, being around people who normalize sin can slowly desensitize your conscience.
If you’re looking for a space like this, let me know. I’d love to start a sisters-only group where we can support each other, share reminders, and build a community. Let’s walk this path together.

>True friendship is one that brings you closer to Jannah.


### 15. Consume Islamic content:
Make it a habit to read Islamic books and listen to podcasts that deepen your understanding of the deen. Whether it’s a series on the Seerah, reflections on the Qur’an, or talks on personal development through faith - these resources help you stay spiritually connected and grounded.


### 16. Make your intentions visible-literally:
Write down any thoughts or methods that you think will be effective for you on paper and stick it somewhere you’ll see often.
It could be your wall, mirror, desk, or even your phone case. Seeing it again and again will help remind you and keep you focused.

**That’s it from me. If you have any proven methods that helped you stay away from these self-destructive habits, do share them in the comment section below. It’ll benefit us—and count as sadaqah jariyah for you (passive reward, just like passive income!). Also, don’t forget to share this with your close ones. That’s another form of sadaqah jariyah!**
