Blackheads. Ugh! Those pesky little dots that seem impossible to get rid of. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got you covered! In this blog, I‚Äôll share two tried-and-true methods to tackle blackheads ‚Äì a DIY trick that‚Äôs super simple and a product-based routine for those who love a bit of skincare pampering. Let‚Äôs dive in!

# Method 1: DIY Blackhead Removal Hack

## What You‚Äôll Need:

- Bentonite clay
- Raw honey
- A few drops of tea tree oil (optional)
- A small bowl and spoon

## Steps:

- **Prep Your Skin:** Tie your hair back and cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser, like Etude House Soon Jung 6.5 Whip Cleanser, to remove dirt and makeup.
- **Mix the Mask:** In a small bowl, combine 1 tsp bentonite clay with 1 tsp honey. Add 1‚Äì2 drops of tea tree oil if your skin is acne-prone.
- **Apply the Mask:** Spread a thin layer over blackhead-prone areas (nose, chin, forehead).
- **Let It Sit:** Leave the mask on for 10‚Äì15 minutes until partially dry. It will gently pull out impurities without over-drying your skin.
- **Rinse Off:** Wash your face with lukewarm water and pat dry.
- **Moisturize:** Finish with a soothing gel to calm the skin. Korean favorite IsNtree Aloe Soothing Gel works perfectly!

### Precautions:

- Always patch-test ingredients like bentonite clay, honey, or tea tree oil on a small area before applying to your face.  
- Avoid using this mask on broken, irritated, or inflamed skin.  
- Do not leave the mask on for longer than 15 minutes to prevent dryness or irritation.  
- Be gentle when removing blackheads‚Äînever force extraction with fingers or pins to avoid scarring or infection.  
- Follow up with a soothing moisturizer or gel, like IsNtree Aloe Soothing Gel, to calm the skin.  
- Limit use to 1‚Äì2 times per week; overuse can compromise your skin barrier.

# Method 2: Product-Based Blackhead Removal Routine

If DIY isn‚Äôt your thing, no worries! Here‚Äôs a simple product-based routine to keep your blackheads in check.

## Step 1:¬†Start with Cleansing Oil

Cleansing oils are amazing for melting away dirt and sebum that clog your pores. Massage a cleansing oil, onto your nose and rinse thoroughly. Never ever forget to emulsify the oil for at least 1 minute before washing it off. If cleansing oil isn't your thing (like me) then you can try cleansing balm too.

## My Pick:

- Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm
- Dr.Althea Pure Grinding Cleansing Balm
- Lanbelle Deep Cleansing Oil (Dry or sensitive skin)
- Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil

  </div>

</div>

## Step 2:¬†Double Cleanse

Follow up with a gentle foam cleanser to remove any leftover residue.

## My Pick:

- ANUA Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam
- ETUDE SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Facial Cleanser

  </div>

</div>


## Step 3:¬†Apply a Pore Mud Pack

This is where the magic happens! Apply a generous layer of a pore clay mask, like the¬†Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask, to your dry nose. Let it work its wonders for 10-15 minutes before washing it off with lukewarm water. The clay helps to draw out impurities and tighten pores.

## My Pick:

- Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask
- Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Pore Refreshing Mask Mud Cream

  </div>

## Step 4:¬†Soothe with Toner Pads

After cleansing, use toner pads to calm and hydrate your skin.¬†NEOGEN Dermalogy Real Cica Pad¬†or¬†BRING GREEN Tea Tree CICA Soothing Toner PAD¬†is a fantastic option to soothe post-mask skin.
