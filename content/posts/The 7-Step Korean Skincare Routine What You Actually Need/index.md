# Step 1: Double Cleanse (The Holy Grail of Clean Skin)

The double cleanse is non-negotiable if you want fresh, clear skin. Why two cleansers? Each one serves a specific purpose:

- **Oil-Based Cleanser:** Removes makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum without stripping your skin.
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm](https://www.banilaco.com/),[The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil](https://www.thefaceshop.com/).
- **Water-Based Cleanser:** Washes away sweat, dirt, and leftover residue from the oil cleanser.
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser](https://www.cosrx.com/), Etude House SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser.

# Step 2: Exfoliate (But Not Every Day!)

Exfoliation is key to removing dead skin cells and unclogging pores, but itâ€™s best to limit it to 1-2 times a week.

- **Physical Exfoliants:** Scrubs with fine granules (gentler options are best).
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [Skinfood Black Sugar Mask Wash Off](https://www.skinfood.com/).
- **Chemical Exfoliants:** AHAs, BHAs, or PHAs for a smoother texture and clearer complexion.
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/).

***Why itâ€™s important*:** Exfoliation preps your skin to absorb the next steps better.

# Step 3: Toner (Hydration, Hydration, Hydration)

Toners in the Korean routine are all about replenishing your skin, not stripping it dry. Skip the alcohol-heavy toners and opt for hydrating ones.

- Look for toners with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, green tea, or centella asiatica for a soothing boost.
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [Etude House SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner](https://www.etudehouse.com/),Â [Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner](https://www.klairscosmetics.com/), iUNIK Tea Tree Relief Toner.
- Apply using your hands and pat it into your skin for maximum absorption.

---

# Step 4: Essence (The Heart of K-Beauty)

An essence is like a concentrated toner or a lightweight serum that hydrates and helps your skin absorb other products.

- Look for ingredients like snail mucin, fermented extracts, or niacinamide for glowing, even-toned skin.
    - â—¦ **Best Picks**:Â [COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/),Â [Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence](https://www.missha.com/).
- Pat gently all over your face after toner.

***Why it matters*:** It enhances hydration and targets specific concerns like dullness or fine lines.

# Step 5: Treatments (Serums and Ampoules)

This step is where you tackle your specific skin concerns:

- **Acne:** Try tea tree oil or salicylic acid.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks*:Â [Some By Mi AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Serum](https://www.somebymi.com/).**
- **Hyperpigmentation:** Vitamin C or arbutin.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks*:Â [Dear, Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum](https://www.klairscosmetics.com/).**
- **Hydration:** Hyaluronic acid or peptides.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks*: COSRX Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule.**

Layer serums based on their consistencyâ€”thinnest to thickestâ€”and wait a minute or two between applications.

# Step 6: Moisturizer (Seal the Deal)

Your moisturizer locks in all the goodness from the previous steps. Choose one based on your skin type:

- **Dry Skin:** Go for rich, creamy formulas.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks***:Â [Belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb](https://www.belifcosmetic.com/).
- **Oily Skin:** Lightweight, gel-based moisturizers work best.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks*: NACIFIC Pink AHA BHA Facial Cream.**
- **Combination Skin:** A balancing moisturizer is your go-to.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks***:Â [COSRX Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion](https://www.cosrx.com/).

# Step 7: Sunscreen (Your Skinâ€™s Best Friend)

If thereâ€™s one step youÂ *must*Â never skip, itâ€™s sunscreen. Korean sunscreens are known for their lightweight, non-greasy formulas that double as a makeup primer.

- Use SPF 30 or higher, and reapply every 2-3 hours if youâ€™re out and about.
    - â—¦ ***Best Picks*:Â [Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics SPF 50+](https://www.beautyofjoseon.com/),Â [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish SPF50+](https://www.etudehouse.com/).**

*Why itâ€™s crucial*: Sunscreen protects your skin from UV damage, preventing premature aging, dark spots, and even skin cancer.
