## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions About Korean Sunscreens

### ❓ Which Korean sunscreen is best for daily use?

Lightweight sunscreens like ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Daily Sun Gel and Beauty of Joseon Daily Relief Sunscreen are ideal for daily wear because they absorb quickly, don’t feel greasy, and sit well under makeup.

### ❓ Are Korean sunscreens good for sensitive skin?

Yes. Many Korean sunscreens are formulated with soothing ingredients like Centella Asiatica, heartleaf, and niacinamide, making them suitable for sensitive and acne-prone skin when used consistently.

### ❓ Do Korean sunscreens leave a white cast?

Most modern Korean sunscreens are designed to be white-cast free, even on deeper skin tones. Gel and serum-based sunscreens usually blend in seamlessly.

### ❓ Should I choose sunscreen based on my skin type?

Absolutely. Dry skin benefits from hydrating formulas with hyaluronic acid, while oily or combination skin does better with lightweight, non-comedogenic sunscreens that control excess oil.

### ❓ Can I skip moisturizer if my sunscreen is hydrating?

If you have oily or combination skin, a hydrating sunscreen may be enough during the day. However, dry skin types should still apply moisturizer before sunscreen, especially in colder months.
