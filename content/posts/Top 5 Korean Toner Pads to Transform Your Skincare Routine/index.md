## **How to Use Toner Pads Effectively**

Using toner pads is incredibly easy and can be seamlessly added to your routine:

- **Start with a clean face 🧼:** Wash your face with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt and makeup.
- **Swipe the pad ✨**: Take a toner pad and gently swipe it across your face and neck. For double-sided pads, use the exfoliating side first, then the soothing side.
- **Focus on problem areas:** Pay extra attention to areas with dryness, irritation, or clogged pores.
- **Let it absorb:** Allow the essence to sink into your skin before applying the next steps in your routine, like moisturizer or [sunscreen](https://shopmy.us/shop/collections/3370372).
- **Seal the deal:** For best results, use the pads daily or as directed on the packaging.
