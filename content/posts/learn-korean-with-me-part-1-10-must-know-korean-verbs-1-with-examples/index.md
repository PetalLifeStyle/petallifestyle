Hey language lovers 👋

Welcome to Part 1 of the "Learn Korean With Me" series!

If you've been wanting to learn Korean but feel overwhelmed by all the letters, grammar rules, and endless textbooks that most online courses throw at you — you're not alone. And you’re totally in the right place.

If you’re here, I’m guessing you’re ready to go beyond just learning the alphabet and want to dive into real, useful Korean vocabulary and phrases. I’ll be skipping the deep grammar lessons for now, since this series will mainly focus on vocab — though I’ll still recommend a few helpful grammar resources along the way.

But before we jump in, just a quick reminder:

📝 You should already know Hangul (the Korean writing system) to follow this series. Trust me — Korean has one of the easiest writing systems to learn once you get the hang of it! You don’t need to be super fluent in reading yet. Just knowing the letters and how to pronounce words is more than enough to get started. With time, you’ll get your tongue rolling!
