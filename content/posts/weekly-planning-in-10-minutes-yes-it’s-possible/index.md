## How to Plan Your Week in 10 Minutes

- **Start with the Big Stuff:** Open your preferred app and block out non-negotiables like meetings, deadlines, and events.
- **Prioritize Tasks:** Choose 1-3 main goals for the week. Add these to your app as top-priority items.
- **Fill in the Gaps:** Use the remaining time slots for smaller tasks or habits you want to maintain, like workouts or study sessions.
- **Review & Adjust:** Spend the last minute reviewing your week. Make sure everything feels manageable and balanced.

## Pro Tip for Better Focus

Block out time for entertainment first. When you know exactly when youâ€™ll get to scroll through your phone or watch reels, it becomes much easier to focus on the task at hand. You wonâ€™t feel distracted or anxious, wondering when youâ€™ll get your downtime. Believe me, it worksâ€”just give it a try!

### Final Thoughts

Planning your week doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With productivity apps like Timepage, Structured, Notion, and Tweek Calendar, you can organize your life in minutes and reclaim your time for the things you love. The key is consistencyâ€”spend 10 minutes every week, and watch your productivity soar! ðŸŒŸ
